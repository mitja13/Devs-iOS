(Tested on iOS 10.x and 11.x, Xcode 8 and 9 beta-4)

## Build Instructions

1. Download the [Devs for iOS Source Code](https://github.com/mitja13/Devs-iOS/archive/master.zip) or   
```
git clone https://github.com/mitja13/Devs-iOS.git
```

2. Install dependency frameworks (only Apollo GraphQL client)
```
pod install
```

3. Create github access token. In Github Settings/Personal access tokens generate new token with scopes `user/read:user` and `user/read:email`. Copy the generated token to Info.plist (and Info-Blue.plist) row in `GithubAccessToken`.

4. Open `Devs.xcworkspace` in Xcode, donâ€™t use Devs.xcodeproj (as will not properly build dependencies)

5. Build and Run
